Example
=======

```ruby
# Players: Vjeux, Gauth, Felix

< Welcome! Please wait for a new game to start.

< Start
> Vjeux    # We send our player name
< Vjeux-0  # We receive a unique player name

< Prisonnier # Let's start a Prisonnier round
< Vjeux-0 Gauth-1 Felix-2 # We receive the list of players
> Gauth-1=T Felix-2=C # We send our decision about all the players
< Gauth-1=T Felix-2=T # We receive the decision of all the players about us

< Pirate # Let's start a Pirate round
< 30 Gauth-1 Vjeux-0 Felix-2 # We receive the bounty along with the players sorted by hierarchy
< Gauth-1=10 Vjeux-0=10 Felix-2=10 # We receive Gauth-1 share of the bounty
> T # We do not agree, we decide to betray him

< Pirate # Gauth-0 has died, another round of Pirate
< 30 Vjeux-0 Felix-2 # We are now the leader
> Vjeux-0=30 Felix-2=0 # We send the shares

< 30 # We gain the full prize!

< Prisonnier # Another round of Prisonnier
< Vjeux-0 Felix-2 # Gauth-1 has been kicked for a round
> Felix-2=T # We betray Felix
< Felix-2=T # He betrays us too

< 0 # We receive a bounty of 0. There is no Pirate round since we are alone in our group.

< End # There was only 2 Prisonnier round
< Vjeux-0=30 Felix-2=0 Gauth-1=0 # We receive the scores of everyone
